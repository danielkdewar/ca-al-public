                  <p>Okay &hellip; arrived safely after loooong plane flight. Managed to contain myself and did not ask &ldquo;Are we there yet&rdquo; once. Was actually lucky to get to Seattle as I answered a question at the airport with &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. The question was &ldquo;Is anyone going to Vila?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Staying at a Worldmark hotel &hellip; The Camlin &hellip; In Seattle. Rooms are lovely and very comfy. First day sightseeing and what a day. Beautiful weather. Went to Pikes Market. Saw the fish being thrown. Amazing sales gimmick. When someone buys a whole fish they throw it from the front to the guy at the back to wrap. Sounds simple but very entertaining. Then caught monorail to Seattle Centre. Fantastic place. It is where the Space Needle is. Visited Chihuly Glass factory. OMGosh &hellip; The glass work is so beautiful. I wish I could show some photos but unfortunately only took my phone and not the tablet so the photos are on there. Will do better next time.
Only two visited the Space Needle &hellip; too high up for me and the lift was on the outside. There was a great fountain at the bottom of this big concrete basin and it was quite okay for kids, and adults, to go down the sloping sides and play amongst the water jets. The entire Seattle Centre complex was a great place.</p>

<p>We are sitting in one of the rooms at the hotel now chilling out and playing with various electronic devices. It is 9.30 at night and has only just gotten dark. We are all a bit quieter tonight. Last night saw lots of alcohol consumed and a merry time was had by all.</p>

<p>Early wake-up call tomorrow as we are off to Victoria Island by ferry.</p>

<p>Before embarking on this trip we all decided we would have a Clanger of the Day Award which would be presented to the person who did or said the funniest or stupidest or bizarre thing that day.</p>

<p><strong>First Clanger of the Day Award</strong></p>

<p>AND THE WINNER IS &hellip;. Bernadette for proudly booking the tickets for the Space Needle on her phone due to the long queue at the ticket kiosk and when checking the receipt later in the day realised she had in fact booked for the next day, when we would no longer be in Seattle. (Recovery was quick though when she explained the situation to someone at the Space Needle who gave them tickets to use immediately. However the quick recovery did not negate the fact that she had made a CLANGER.)</p>
