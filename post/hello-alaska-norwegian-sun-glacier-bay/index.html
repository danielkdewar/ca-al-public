                  <p>We do not get off the ship any more, but today the ship sailed into Glacier Bay.  We saw a couple of minor glaciers, but the cream of the crop was Margerie Glacier.  I have said it before, but I think that glaciers are one of nature&rsquo;s most wonderful creations.  The noise they make as they calve (drop pieces of the glacier off into the water) is amazing, as is the sight of big pieces of ice falling into the water.</p>

<p>It was hard to get a photo of an actual calving as they happen very quickly.  Sometimes the noise is like a rumble of thunder and sometimes like a whip crack or rifle shot.</p>

<p>The weather for today was cloudy with periods of rain, but the cloud was high enough that the glacier was clear, so our luck held and we were able to see the glacier the whole time we were there.  The ship got a lot closer than I thought it would, which was fantastic.  The weather did clear somewhat later in the day.</p>

<p>That night, which was the last night on the ship, was a relatively quiet one and when I returned to my cabin it was still daylight.  I was disappointed to see that there was no towel animal on my bed, but just thought that as it was the last night, perhaps Roy hadn&rsquo;t had time to do them.  I actually saw the beautiful sunset from my cabin window and managed to photograph it, but the photo does not do its beauty justice.</p>

<p>After I had been in my cabin for about half an hour looking at the sunset out the window, I lay down on the bed for a minute, and as my eyes looked upward, I was delighted to see my towel animal, a monkey, swinging from above the mirror.  I have to look up more often.  I must miss a lot.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we leave the ship and set out on our trip to Talkeetna and our Alaskan land adventure</p>

<p><strong>Hubbard Glacier</strong></p>

<p>The last day of the cruise was a visit to Hubbard Glacier. Now, opinion was divided as to which glacier was &ldquo;better&rdquo;, but all agreed both were &ldquo;amazing&rdquo;. Hubbard is a very active glacier and while we did not see as much calving, it was very noisy, with lots of &ldquo;thunder&rdquo; rumbling and whip cracks.  While the weather was cooler, it did not stop us from spending ages watching another wonder of Mother Nature.</p>
