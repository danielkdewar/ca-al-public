                  <p>Today we regretfully left Quebec behind and headed for Toronto.  We had all loved our time in Quebec and I wished it had been longer.</p>

<p>We flew from Quebec to Toronto - landing at Billy Bishop Airport which is on a little island off mainland Toronto.  A tunnel has been built underwater from Billy Bishop over to Toronto proper and is a very short, less than 10 minute walk, even lugging luggage (again - that must be how it got its name).  There are moving walkways and it is bright and cheerful.</p>

<p>When we exited the tunnel, we found a cab and asked to be driven to the address we had been given.  The cab driver said it would be $10 additional on top of the fare for luggage.  This was definitely NOT okay with us, so with Mark consulting address and map, we decided we should be able to walk.  The address turned out to be only a few blocks from where we were, so walking was a good decision.</p>

<p>We also saw an animal with a very fluffy black tail and at first I wondered if it was a kitten, but as it ran up and down the trees, we realised it was in fact a black squirrel.  I didn&rsquo;t even know you could get black squirrels.</p>

<p>We were greeted by a lovely friend of the owner of the apartment and taken up to what turned out to be our best Air BnB accommodation - lovely unit - two bedrooms, spacious lounge, nice kitchen area and it was a great amount of room for us for 3 nights.  We were also given a tour of the roof area - which was inside and outside.  Lovely tables inside for chatting or just spending some time alone and tables/chairs set out all around the outside terrace area.  There was a sauna, steam room and small gym up there too.</p>

<p>We looked up at one stage and there was the CN Tower (Canadian National Tower) &hellip; so close we could almost touch it.</p>

<p>Here are some photos of our first impressions of Toronto seen from the roof top terrace of our apartment &hellip;</p>

<p>After we settled in, we went out onto our 3rd floor patio and enjoyed the sunset and the changing colours of the CN Tower.</p>
