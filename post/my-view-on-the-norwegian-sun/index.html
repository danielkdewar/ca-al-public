                  <p>I am afraid that I am a &ldquo;review&rdquo; reader and had read a lot of reviews on the Norwegian Sun cruises, specifically the Alaskan ones.  There were a number of reviews that complained about the food, the &ldquo;outdatedness&rdquo;  (another word I just made up) of the ship and other things. I admit I was a bit cautious about what sort of time we would have and as we all love to eat, was especially worried about those bad reviews.</p>

<p>To be honest, I have no idea what the nay-sayers were complaining about.  The food was good, plenty of it and available just about any time day or night.  The ship did not look outdated, the cabins were comfortable and reasonably roomy and the bathroom, while small, was good enough to allow for great, long showers and the things you do at a bathroom basin.</p>

<p>The shows were good.  I was particularly impressed with the second last night performance by the ship&rsquo;s resident entertainment singers and dancers and at the end of that performance, they introduced lots of members of the ship&rsquo;s crew from officers, to chefs, to room stewards and finally, the all-important &ldquo;washy washy&rdquo; girls.  I haven&rsquo;t mentioned it before, but every time you go into a restaurant or buffet, there are lovely crew there with spray bottles of a disinfectant/antiseptic solution, saying &ldquo;washy washy &hellip; happy happy&rdquo; as they sprayed your hands.  I had read reviews complaining about this procedure, but it was part of the fun on the ship.</p>

<p>The main difference I did notice between this cruise and the Princess line, was that waiters did not come to you as often as they did on Princess cruises to ask what you would like to drink and sometimes the wait for a drink was a long one, but that is such a minor thing really.  If you can&rsquo;t wait 5-10 minutes for a drink to arrive, then I think you might have a problem.</p>

<p>All in all, I would recommend the Norwegian Sun and the Norwegian line for any sort of cruise you would like to take.</p>
