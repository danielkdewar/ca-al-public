                  <p>What a great day the travellers had in Vancouver today.  Catching the free shuttle bus, we went to the Capilano Suspension Bridge Park and as the name suggests, there is a suspension bridge.  It is quite a long one and moves a lot because there is usually a lot of people on it.  With the hub&rsquo;s insight (obtained from reading reviews on Trip Advisor), the travellers went early when it wasn&rsquo;t quite as busy.  First thing was to cross the suspension bridge.  Our braver members strode confidently along, but there were a few of us who were not going to let go of the sort-of railing.  It wasn&rsquo;t the height so much that got to me, but the damn thing won&rsquo;t stop moving, which is quite unnerving for nervous first-timers. The bridge can take a lot of weight and is usually situated above a rapidly running river, but at this stage of summer, it is only a little stream running underneath.  There are a few steps to go down to get to the bridge and these are also moving and swaying.</p>

<p>Once over to the other side there are lovely little nature boardwalks and a treetop walk with platforms about half-way up massive douglas firs and western red cedars.  The platforms are linked by smaller length suspension bridges, which sway somewhat, but nothing like the larger one.  It is a beautiful walk with great views.  The weather was clear, but not sunny, so it wasn&rsquo;t too hot - lots of stairs to climb, all handled reasonably well by a very out of shape hub and handled really well by the spokes, except for poor Helen who has managed to put her back out and is in a lot of pain, but she soldiered on regardless.</p>

<p>We came down out of the trees and followed the trail along to raptor ridge where three handlers were waiting with an owl, a red-tailed hawk and a harris hawk - all very regal looking birds.</p>

<p>From there we followed the nature boardwalk and once again had to cross the suspension bridge to get back over and ended up back near the entrance where Liz and I decided to do the cliff walk.  I thought this would be a big test of my nervousness in relation to heights, but it turned out to be quite easy.  I was quite amazed - where were my squeamish stomach and my sweating and fears?  The actual part of the walk that juts out around the cliff face over the ravine below is quite short, but the views are truly stunning.  Right at the very end there is a larger platform that has a metal grated floor, through which you can see all the way to the bottom.  This did pull me up for a second or so, but I ended up out there with Liz, where a very obliging Asian family took our photo.</p>

<p>So having conquered the suspension bridge, the treetop walk and the cliff walk, we all enjoyed a very welcome lunch.</p>

<p>The price to go to the Capilano Suspension Bridge Park is CAD$34.95, which I feel was quite worth it.</p>

<p>The intention had been to the go to Grouse Mountain, but with a price of CAD$44, plus taxes, to ride in a gondola up a mountain not as high as the one we had done in Whistler, it was back on the shuttle bus and back to the accommodation. We all did various things, depending on our preferences and met up again at 4.30pm for happy the hotel bar.</p>

<p><strong>Handy Tip</strong>
The price you see most places in US and Canada is not the price you will end up paying.  In Australia the price displayed usually includes GST already, but over here the price given does not include their taxes and so when you get to the register, the price is always higher than you thought it was.</p>

<p><strong>Another Handy Tip</strong>
When planning your trip, be sure to also factor in tipping.  It is expected over here and a lot are not backward in coming forward to let you know they would appreciate it.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we leave Vancouver and Canada (temporarily) for our Alaskan cruise on board the Norwegian Sun, disembarking in 7 days time in Seward, Alaska.</p>

<p>So make sure you stay tuned for further riveting adventures of the hub and her 6 spokes.</p>
