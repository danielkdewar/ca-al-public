       <h3 class="post-subtitle"></h3>
       <p class="post-summary">Day 2 in Vancouver started slowly for the hub. Bit of a lie-in, then downstairs late morning where the doorman talked me out of going anywhere until after midday due to a half marathon being held and road closures relating to that. So, after midday I went down and waited for a hop-on, hop-off bus to Stanley Park. This park is 150 acres larger than New York&rsquo;s Central Park. After about 50 minutes, decided there might be some problems with the hop-on, hop-off bus, so got a taxi to the Park.</p>

       <h3 class="post-subtitle"></h3>
       <p class="post-summary">This afternoon we left beautiful Whistler for Vancouver. Our limo (yes, another one) wasn&rsquo;t picking us up until 1.00pm, for Helen and I took a walk to Lost Lake. They have to change the name now because we found it. Although Helen and some of the others had found it on our first day in Whistler, it really only mattered when the hub found it. It was about 50 minutes to get there (could scout Helen have perhaps taken me the wrong [sorry, a different] way?</p>

       <h3 class="post-subtitle"></h3>
       <p class="post-summary">What an action packed day it was for the travellers in Whistler today (15 August 2015). After a leisurely breakfast, the six spokes and the hub tagging along for beautification purposes, went to the Olympic Sliding Centre (yes THE Olympic Sliding Centre used in the 2010 Olympic Winter Games) to do some bobsledding. In summer they put wheels on the bobsleds and run them down the actual Olympic track, although you don&rsquo;t start until the 7th gate, so not right from the very top.</p>

       <h3 class="post-subtitle"></h3>
       <p class="post-summary">Thanks to Spoke Wayne&rsquo;s beautiful organising we were picked up from our Victoria Worldmark accommodation and whisked away in a black Mercedes Sprinter (10 seater) to another ferry for the trip across to mainland Canada. Huge ferry &hellip; three decks of cars and semis and buses and decks with eating facilities, lounges etc. Approx 90-minute trip and we continued in our Mercedes Sprinter through to Whistler. This was a good couple of hours stretch, through the city of Vancouver and on.</p>

       <h3 class="post-subtitle"></h3>
       <p class="post-summary">On the morning of 11 August (Canadian time) we caught a ferry from Seattle to Vancouver Island (Victoria) and finally after 45 years of dreaming on my part, myself and the six spokes arrived in Canada. I was so excited (as was everyone). Checked into our accommodation at Worldmark Kingston and went to Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf for a lunch of fish and chips.
Once I get the code worked out for inserting photos you will be able to see some of the beautiful things I have seen &hellip;by George I think I&rsquo;ve got it.</p>

       <h3 class="post-subtitle"></h3>
       <p class="post-summary">The water in the toilet DOES flush the other way; light and power switches operate the opposite way; Americans/Canadians are very polite, when going up and down stairs - walk on the opposite side to home and so far, most importantly, when crossing a road, look to the LEFT first, the LEFT &hellip; always the LEFT first.</p>

       <p class="post-summary">Okay &hellip; arrived safely after loooong plane flight. Managed to contain myself and did not ask &ldquo;Are we there yet&rdquo; once. Was actually lucky to get to Seattle as I answered a question at the airport with &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. The question was &ldquo;Is anyone going to Vila?&rdquo;
Staying at a Worldmark hotel &hellip; The Camlin &hellip; In Seattle. Rooms are lovely and very comfy. First day sightseeing and what a day. Beautiful weather.</p>

       <h3 class="post-subtitle"></h3>
       <p class="post-summary">Well, 3 sleeps to go and I have finally decided to do something about packing. I am one of those people who don&rsquo;t like to have everything done and dusted well before time because it seems to make things go faster if I wait. So I waited and now am slightly panicked.
What on earth do I take? Going to Canada and Alaska, admittedly in the last month of their summer, I would think that basically pants/t-shirts and one, maybe two, good outfits would do, with a jumper.</p>

       <h3 class="post-subtitle"></h3>
       <p class="post-summary">For me this trip has been 45 years in the making. I started dreaming about it when just a teenager and finally, at the age of 60, will leave on 8 August 2015. I am taking the trip with 6 friends - all couples. Some might say I am the seventh wheel, but I prefer to think of it as being the central hub and the others as the spokes that revolve around me!</p>
