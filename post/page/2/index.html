       <h3 class="post-subtitle"></h3>
       <p class="post-summary">After another good night&rsquo;s sleep, except perhaps for Helen, who is not very well at the moment, most of us had a leisurely start to the day. Liz and Mark were off to do ziplining and the rest of us were just content to enjoy our surroundings and have a bit of a rest day before we start travelling again tomorrow.
Liz and Mark returned in time for lunch at the local cafe - Latitude 62 (because this is the latitude Talkeetna is situated at), and which is just 2 minutes up the road.</p>

       <p class="post-summary">Five of the spokes decided that their activity for the day would be an ATV adventure, so Wayne, Bernie, Don, Helen and Mark headed out in a procession behind Dennis (the owner of the tour) for a trip through the countryside and a visit to his home and some gold panning in the stream that runs through his property.
Liz and I had been unsure of our ability to handle the ATV, so elected to take a 3-river jet boat tour of the Chulitna, Susitna and Talkeetna Rivers.</p>

       <h3 class="post-subtitle"></h3>
       <p class="post-summary">After a great night&rsquo;s sleep in the Ramada Anchorage&rsquo;s very comfy beds, we got a shuttle to the station for the Denali Star train to Talkeetna. (The Ramada Anchorage is no oil painting, but the comfiness of the beds and the lovely meal available at the Slippery Salmon next door, made up for that). The photo below shows the original steam train on the line.
The train trip was, I think, a little disappointing.</p>

       <h3 class="post-subtitle"></h3>
       <p class="post-summary">Today we disembarked the ship (a very quick, easy procedure) and got our bus for the journey to Anchorage. We opted for an all-day bus trip that took in the scenery, sights and allowed for photo stops along the way, along with a visit to Exit Glacier and the Alaskan Wildlife Conservation Centre. Another glacier I hear you ask???? Yes, another glacier, but just as spectacular as the others we had seen.</p>

       <h3 class="post-subtitle"></h3>
       <p class="post-summary">I am afraid that I am a &ldquo;review&rdquo; reader and had read a lot of reviews on the Norwegian Sun cruises, specifically the Alaskan ones. There were a number of reviews that complained about the food, the &ldquo;outdatedness&rdquo; (another word I just made up) of the ship and other things. I admit I was a bit cautious about what sort of time we would have and as we all love to eat, was especially worried about those bad reviews.</p>

       <h3 class="post-subtitle"></h3>
       <p class="post-summary">We do not get off the ship any more, but today the ship sailed into Glacier Bay. We saw a couple of minor glaciers, but the cream of the crop was Margerie Glacier. I have said it before, but I think that glaciers are one of nature&rsquo;s most wonderful creations. The noise they make as they calve (drop pieces of the glacier off into the water) is amazing, as is the sight of big pieces of ice falling into the water.</p>

       <h3 class="post-subtitle"></h3>
       <p class="post-summary">After another lovely night&rsquo;s sleep, we arrived in Skagway. This was my pick of the three places visited by the Norwegian Sun. So quaint, so lovely, so old fashioned. The sidewalks were boardwalks and the shopfronts really gave it that old time &ldquo;town in the wilderness&rdquo; feel.
The tour I was on did not leave until nearly midday, so I spent a good deal of time walking around the town, which was a very easy walk.</p>

       <h3 class="post-subtitle"></h3>
       <p class="post-summary">It has been a while since I blogged, so hopefully I won&rsquo;t forget too much that has happened. I do have Old Timer&rsquo;s you know.
Juneau was, in my eyes anyway, not as quaint and lovely as Ketchikan - a bit more upmarket. As it is the capital of Alaska, I guess that is why. Helen, Don and I did a Mendenhall Glacier and Whale Watching tour together. Once again, the weather blessed us.</p>

       <h3 class="post-subtitle"></h3>
       <p class="post-summary">Just a quick blog today. We are all sharing internet time bought by the Mitchells and the rest of us will give them money towards their cost.
Boarded the Norwegian Sun on Monday 17 August 2015 (Vancouver time). Boarding was very efficient. Of course when you are boarding all those passengers you are undoubtedly going to have to stand in queues, but these were all managed very well - all under cover and sheltered from the weather.</p>

       <h3 class="post-subtitle"></h3>
       <p class="post-summary">What a great day the travellers had in Vancouver today. Catching the free shuttle bus, we went to the Capilano Suspension Bridge Park and as the name suggests, there is a suspension bridge. It is quite a long one and moves a lot because there is usually a lot of people on it. With the hub&rsquo;s insight (obtained from reading reviews on Trip Advisor), the travellers went early when it wasn&rsquo;t quite as busy.</p>
