                  <p>This afternoon we left beautiful Whistler for Vancouver.  Our limo (yes, another one) wasn&rsquo;t picking us up until 1.00pm, for Helen and I took a walk to Lost Lake.  They have to change the name now because we found it.  Although Helen and some of the others had found it on our first day in Whistler, it really only mattered when the hub found it.  It was about 50 minutes to get there (could scout Helen have perhaps taken me the wrong [sorry, a different] way?)  We reached the lake, took a few photos and on the return decided to do the nature trail that Helen had done with the others a couple of days earlier.  Twenty minutes to return. Hmmmmm &hellip; something wrong with those calculations.  Anyway, knees held up beautifully (and so they should, being titanium).  Left foot was sore, but I soldiered on, like the true trooper hub that I am.</p>

<p>If Whistler is on some future travel agenda of yours, you could always bring your mountain bike (or ordinary bicycle) or hire one.  The trails are clear and well marked.  There are mountain bike trails all over the mountains and people take their bikes up on the gondolas and chairlifts and then ride them down.</p>

<p>When we got back it wasn&rsquo;t long before the limo arrived and in we all piled and all our luggage.  Another Mercedes Sprinter - very comfortable and spacious.  As we get to each new place and do some shopping for groceries and drink, the little extra bits and pieces of luggage to take to the next spot seems to be multiplying.</p>

<p>The scenery on the way back to Vancouver was breathtaking and although we had gone the same way down to Whistler, we saw things that we had missed on the trip down.  I don&rsquo;t think the fact that most of us slept a lot of the way to Whistler had anything to do with it!!!!  There was much more snow on the mountains on the way back and it was so pretty.  I am going to have to get a thesaurus because the words &ldquo;pretty&rdquo;, &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo;, &ldquo;gorgeous&rdquo; and &ldquo;breathtaking&rdquo; seem to be appearing a lot.</p>

<p>After a hold-up coming back over the bridge to our part of Vancouver (the lanes are either two open one way and one the other or vice versa and we had the one lane option) and at one stage having 5 lanes merging into that one open one, we made it safely to the Century Plaza Hotel - our accommodation for the next 3 nights.  The rooms are lovely and spacious and I have a huge king size bed - all to myself.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is supposed to be rainy here, so I am not sure what is happening, but Sunday we are going to Capilano Suspension Bridge Park and Grouse Mountain - so should be lots to report then.  I am hoping to get to Dr Sun Yan Set Classical Chinese Garden tomorrow, so will report further tomorrow night.</p>

<p>So hello to everyone back home from me over here in Vancouver - CANADA baby.</p>
